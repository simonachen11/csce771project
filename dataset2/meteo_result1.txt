It ' s   in   my   heart . " Darlene   Knapp   said   Tom   pursued   her   as   she   left   the   house ,   holding   the   gun   against   her . " I   was   scared   I   was   going   to   get   shot   in   the   back , "   she   said . Able   to   escape ,   Darlene   called   911   a   second   time   from   outside ,   and   officers   soon   arrived   while   Tom   Knapp   remained   inside   the   house . Knapp ' s   attorneys   say   his   actions   were   justified   and   he   shot   Juzek   in   self - defense . In   an   audio   recording   of   Knapp ' s   interview   with   investigators   played   Thursday   for   the   jury ,   Knapp   said   Darlene   had   threatened   her   with   the   stick ,   and   he   took   it   from   her   and   hit   her .   Darlene   Knapp   said   raccoons   probably   knocked   it   over ,   but   she   knew   Tom   likely   would   blame   her   son ,   Kevin   Juzek ,   who   lived   in   their   basement . " We   was   probably   blaming   both   of   us , "   Darlene   Knapp   said ,   testifying   that   her   husband   didn ' t   like   having   Juzek   in   their   home ,   but   there   had   never   been   any   physical   confrontations   between   them
Tom   Knapp   is   on   trial   for   the   murder   of   his   stepson   Kevin   Juzek   in   Plymouth   County   District   Court   in   Iowa .   Knapp   has   pleaded   not   guilty   to   charges   of   first - degree   murder   and   willful   injury   for   the   shooting   of   Juzek   on   May   11 ,   2020 .   Knapp   is   also   charged   with   willful   injury   and   domestic   assault   for   assaulting   his   wife   Darlene   prior   to   the   shooting .   According   to   Darlene ' s   testimony ,   Knapp   punched   her   in   the   face   at   least   twice ,   knocked   her   down ,   and   struck   her   with   a   wooden   exercise   stick   in   their   bedroom .   Juzek   then   stepped   in   to   stop   the   assault   and   held   the   bedroom   door   shut   so   Darlene   could   call   911 .   Knapp   then   shot   Juzek   through   the   bedroom   door   and   again   at   point - blank   range   in   the   living   room .   Knapp ' s   attorneys   claim   that   his   actions   were   justified   and   that   he   shot   Juzek   in   self - defense .   The   trial   will   continue   with   closing   arguments   on   Tuesday   morning .
