Tom Knapp is on trial for the murder of his stepson Kevin Juzek in Plymouth County District Court in Iowa. Knapp has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and willful injury for the shooting of Juzek on May 11, 2020. Knapp is also charged with willful injury and domestic assault for assaulting his wife Darlene prior to the shooting. According to Darlene's testimony, Knapp punched her in the face at least twice, knocked her down, and struck her with a wooden exercise stick in their bedroom. Juzek then stepped in to stop the assault and held the bedroom door shut so Darlene could call 911. Knapp then shot Juzek through the bedroom door and again at point-blank range in the living room. Knapp's attorneys claim that his actions were justified and that he shot Juzek in self-defense. The trial will continue with closing arguments on Tuesday morning.
