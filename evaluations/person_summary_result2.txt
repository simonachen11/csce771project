According to data released by the FBI, the number of reported hate crimes in South Carolina decreased slightly from 110 in 2020 to 106 in 2021. However, this only reflects the numbers that local law enforcement agencies voluntarily provided to the FBI, as they are not required to report these statistics. In 2021, 87% of South Carolina agencies reported their figures, which is more than the year before. While the number of reported hate crimes has slightly decreased, it is nearly double the 57 reported in 2019. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program classifies hate crimes as criminal offenses motivated by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity. In South Carolina, 49 of the 106 reported hate crimes were motivated by race or ethnicity, while 32 were motivated by religion. There has been an increase in hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation in both South Carolina and nationwide, with 19 incidents reported in the state in 2021, compared to 12 the year before.
